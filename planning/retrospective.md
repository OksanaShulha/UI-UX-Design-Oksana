## What was good?

I learned how to build responsive design with help of CSS Framework. First time in my life I've got my portfolio web site (in progress for a while)

I comunicated with my partner, learned how to take interview, to draw wireframe and on base of that on to draw layout for real website.

## What was bad?

I couldn't develop responsive web site according with my layout. Whole Home Page with 5 sections was for me impossible challenge (hopefully it is only for now). Even with Bootstrap a lot of items were "jumping". Eventually I've created only 2 sections.

## Actions

To watch more tutorial videos and to do more practice.
