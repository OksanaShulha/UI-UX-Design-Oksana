## Time

Classically time is the first place in my Constraints. We havw only to weeks to create this project and to learn a lot a lot of new information. Seems to me it ia not enough especially if a project's got “in trouble”.

## Scope

We should be flexible because a half of project is a group project. We have to dive in absolutely new space such as: CSS Framework (Bootstrap in my case) and Open Source Software (Figma).

## Quality

The project isn't "perfectly well done". I have still a lot to learn

## Benefits

I was already familiar with Figma
